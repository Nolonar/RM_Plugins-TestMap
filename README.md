# N_TestMap
Adds option to launch test map instead of regular game.

- Adds the option only when play-testing (when game is launched from RPG Maker), so it's ok to forget to remove the plugin before release (although it's still recommended).
- Disables autosave when test map was launched (as opposed to "New Game" or "Continue").
